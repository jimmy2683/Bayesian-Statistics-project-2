Project 2: Advanced MCMC Methods Analysis Summary
================================================
Generated on: Mon Nov 17 22:17:05 IST 2025
Analysis Duration: Started at script execution

Files Generated:
- Execution logs in logs/
- Summary statistics in results/
- Diagnostic plots in figures/

Key Components Executed:
1. Metropolis-Hastings MCMC implementation
2. Gibbs Sampling implementation  
3. Convergence diagnostics
4. Posterior comparison across methods
5. Autocorrelation analysis
6. Summary statistics generation

Next Steps:
- Review logs/ for detailed execution output
- Examine results/ for numerical summaries
- Check figures/ for diagnostic plots
- Use report_template.md to structure final report
- Include results in academic writeup
